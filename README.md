# Threshold-and-Counting-Non-Black-Pixels
This program written in Python captures the video from the web cam. The frame is divided into 3 parts. The user can specify the HSV range and change the filter (threshold) of the captured video. The user can see the non-black pixel count in every region by pressing the buttons.
This project was my term project of OOP course. You can find the tasks that this practical work must provide in **'OOP_Term_Project.pdf'** file.
